In this game, you navigate through a grid filled with walls and enemies. Enemies move predictably, changing direction upon hitting a wall. Running into an enemy means instant game over. Your objective is to defeat enemies by placing down bombs ("B" on the keyboard), that explodes within a 7 Ã— 7 radius, that also means danger for the player. The game offers features like starting new games, pausing, and signaling when the game concludes. It also keeps track of time and the number of enemies you've defeated.
